### Java Digital Marketplace Example
This project uses the Java toolkits provided in the following projects to demonstrate how a
crypto-payment based digital marketplace can be setup using a simple web service and CLI:
 * [java-digital-notary](https://github.com/craterdog-crypto-payments/java-digital-notary)
 * [java-digital-identities](https://github.com/craterdog-crypto-payments/java-digital-identities)
 * [java-digital-tokens](https://github.com/craterdog-crypto-payments/java-digital-tokens)
 * [java-digital-accounting](https://github.com/craterdog-crypto-payments/java-digital-accounting)

It is not meant to be used as a robust implementation but demonstrates the power the toolkits.
